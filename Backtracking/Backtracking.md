* [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1294720/whats-the-difference-between-backtracking-and-depth-first-search)
* Backtracking is a more general purpose algorithm.
* DFS is a specific form of backtracking related to searching tree structures.
* DFS uses backtracking as part of its means of working with a tree, but is limited to a tree structure.
* For example, in a chessboard u can look at a specific move and eliminate it then backtrack to the next possible move, etc.
